* Documentation *is* the system
* LayerCake is *not* a generator
* LayerCake handles the following orthogonalities:
	* Configuration per environment
	* Logging
	* Caching
	* Analytics
	* Tests
	* Error handling
	* Data migration
	* Data transformation: encryption, anti-tampering measures, compression
	* Deployment (???) (e.g. each layer-cake is a separate SOA component)

* Is this... some kind of data-oriented design? I describe actions that need to be taken as the data is passing through the system.
