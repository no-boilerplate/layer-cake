* Documentation *is* the system
* LayerCake is *not* a generator
* LayerCake handles the following orthogonalities:
	* Configuration per environment
	* Logging
	* Caching
	* Analytics
	* Tests
	* Error handling
	* Monitoring
	* Data migration
	* Data transformation: encryption, anti-tampering measures, compression
	* Deployment (???) (e.g. each layer-cake is a separate SOA component)

* Is this... some kind of data-oriented design? I describe actions that need to be taken as the data is passing through the system.

## Protocols

Every extensible and composable system must be based on protocols, on mutual understanding of both consumer and provider of what, when and how information is shared. LayerCake is both extensible and composable and as such needs several core protocols that enable these characteristics.

### Stack execution protocol

### Store communication protocol

### JSON API protocol

### Error protocol

## Guarantees
